        //
        // Commas are used to separate items in lists, as in They own a cat, a dog, two rabbits, and six mice. In English, a comma may or may not be used before the final conjunction (and, or, nor) in a list of more than two elements. A comma used in such a position is called a serial comma or an Oxford or Harvard comma (after the Oxford University Press and Harvard University Press, both prominent advocates of this style). In some cases, use or omission of such a comma may serve to avoid ambiguity:
        //
        // Use of serial comma disambiguating:
        //  * I spoke to the boys, Sam and Tom. – could be either the boys and Sam and Tom (I spoke to more than three people) or the boys, who are Sam and Tom (I spoke to two people)
        //  * I spoke to the boys, Sam, and Tom. – must be the boys and Sam and Tom (I spoke to more than three people)
        //
        // Omission of serial comma disambiguating:
        //  * I thank my mother, Anne Smith, and Thomas. – could be either my mother and Anne Smith and Thomas (three people) or my mother, who is Anne Smith, and Thomas (two people)
        //  * I thank my mother, Anne Smith and Thomas. – The writer is thanking three people: the writer's mother and Anne Smith (who is not the writer's mother) and Thomas.
        //
        // As a rule of thumb, The Guardian Style Guide[5] suggests that straightforward lists (he ate ham, eggs and chips) do not need a comma before the final "and", but sometimes it can help the reader (he ate cereal, kippers, bacon, eggs, toast and marmalade, and tea.) The Chicago Manual of Style, and other academic writing guides, require the "serial comma": all lists must have a comma before the "and" prefacing the last item in a series.
        // If the individual items of a list are long, complex, affixed with description, or themselves contain commas, semicolons may be preferred as separators; and sometimes the list may be introduced with a colon.
        //
        fail("Unit test not written.");

    public void testUseForSeparationOfClauses()
    {
        //Separation of clauses
        //Commas are often used to separate clauses. In English, a comma is generally used to separate a dependent clause from the independent clause if the dependent clause comes first: After I fed the cat, I brushed my clothes. (Compare this with I brushed my clothes after I fed the cat.) A relative clause takes commas if it is non-restrictive, as in I cut down all the trees, which were over six feet tall. (Without the comma, this would mean that only those trees over six feet tall were cut down.)
        //Some style guides prescribe that two independent clauses joined by a coordinating conjunction (for, and, nor, but, or, yet, so) must be separated by a comma placed before the conjunction.[6][7] In the following sentences, where the second clause is independent (because it can stand alone as a sentence), the comma is considered by those guides to be necessary:
        //Mary walked to the party, but she was unable to walk home.
        //Designer clothes are silly, and I can't afford them anyway.
        //Don't push that button, or twelve tons of high explosives will go off right under our feet!
        //But in the following sentences, where the second clause is dependent (because it cannot stand alone as a sentence), those guides prescribe that the comma be omitted:
        //Mary walked to the party but was unable to walk home.
        //I think designer clothes are silly and can't afford them anyway.
        //Don't push that button or set off the twelve tons of high explosives sitting right under our feet.
        //However, the comma may be omitted if the second independent clause is very short, typically when the second independent clause is an imperative.[6][7] In the following sentences, it is sometimes considered acceptable to omit the comma, even though the second clause is independent:
        //Sit down and shut up.
        //Run to the end of the diving board and jump.
        //Come over here and kiss me.
        //In some languages, such as German and Polish, stricter rules apply on comma usage between clauses, with dependent clauses always being set off with commas, and commas being generally proscribed before certain coordinating conjunctions.
        //The joining of two independent sentences with a comma and no conjunction (as in "It is nearly half past five, we cannot reach town before dark.") is known as a comma splice and is often considered an error in English; in most cases a semicolon should be used instead. A comma splice should not be confused, though, with asyndeton, a literary device used for a specific effect in which coordinating conjunctions are purposely omitted.
